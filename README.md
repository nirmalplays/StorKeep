## What is StorKeep?

Filecoin storage deals have fixed expiry epochs. When a deal expires, your data is no longer guaranteed to persist on the network. StorKeep is the missing infrastructure layer — it monitors your Filecoin deals, prices renewals in real time, and executes them on-chain automatically through Lighthouse RaaS before your data disappears.

No alerts. No dashboards. No manual steps. Your data stays alive.

---

## Features

- **Live Deal Dashboard** — Query any Filecoin deal ID and get instant status: provider miner, expiry countdown, renewal cost in USDC
- **One-Click Renewal** — Submits a real on-chain transaction via the Lighthouse RaaS contract
- **Auto-Renew Mode** — Monitors deals continuously and renews automatically when the expiry threshold is crossed
- **Autopilot** — Register a deal once, StorKeep watches it forever
- **On-Chain Registry** — Every renewal is recorded in the StorKeep Registry smart contract on Filecoin Calibration
- **Agent Economy** — Autonomous producer and consumer agents demonstrating a self-sustaining decentralized storage marketplace
- **x402 Payments** — Live USDC payment flow on Base Sepolia via x402-next
- **Vault Wallet** — Dedicated Filecoin wallet for gas payments, separate from connected MetaMask

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- npm or yarn
- A Filecoin Calibration wallet with tFIL ([get from faucet](https://faucet.calibration.fildev.network/))
- Neon PostgreSQL database

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirmalplays/StorKeep.git
cd StorKeep/storkeep-app
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in `storkeep-app/`:

```env
# Required
FILECOIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
FILECOIN_RPC_URL=https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1
LIGHTHOUSE_RAAS_CONTRACT=0x4015c3E5453d38Df71539C0F7440603C69784d7a
STORKEEP_REGISTRY_CONTRACT=0x7CC100a2c115e5B02F7BbaC7616D290A17D89397
STORKEEP_WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=postgresql://...
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=postgresql://...

# Optional
CRON_SECRET=your_random_secret
```

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## SDK

StorKeep's core logic is published as a standalone npm package:

```bash
npm install storkeep-sdk
```

```typescript
import { StorKeep } from 'storkeep-sdk'

const sk = new StorKeep({
  privateKey: process.env.FILECOIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY,
  network: 'calibration',
})

// Check deal status
const status = await sk.getDealStatus('217302')
console.log(status.daysUntilExpiry, status.renewalCostUsdc)

// Renew a deal
const result = await sk.renewDeal('217302')
console.log(result.filfoxUrl)
```

## Agent Economy

StorKeep includes a demonstration of an autonomous storage marketplace:

**Producer agents** store data on Filecoin, post listings with a price per retrieval, and earn USDFC when consumers retrieve their data.

**Consumer agents** discover listings, pay for retrievals autonomously, and their budgets deplete in real time. When a consumer runs out of funds, it dies.

**StorKeep is the foundation:** every producer agent's data is backed by a Filecoin deal. StorKeep renews those deals automatically — without it, the entire agent economy collapses the moment a deal expires.

To start the agent economy demo:
1. Go to the dashboard
2. Click **Start Economy**
3. Watch producers store, consumers pay, and budgets flow in real time

---

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

```bash
npm install -g vercel
cd StorKeep  # root of the repo
vercel --prod
```

Set all environment variables in **Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables** before deploying.
